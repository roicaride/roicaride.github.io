## 💡 About this Project

This portfolio marks my first real-world implementation of front-end technologies into a complete web project. It was a valuable learning experience, allowing me to:

- Understand and apply responsive design principles.
- Integrate external JavaScript libraries (Particles.js).
- Implement modern CSS techniques, including Flexbox and Grid.
- Develop a structured, maintainable codebase.

I recognize there's always room for improvement. I'm actively seeking feedback and will continually update this project as I learn and grow.
